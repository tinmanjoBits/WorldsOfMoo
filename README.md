===========

Minecraft type clone.

Having seen the source to Minecraft I wanted to see if it was possible to make a 2d one but with:-

-Blocks which used composition instead of inheritance for adding abilites and functions
-functions and ability classes act as merly added methods
-Avoid interfaces

I am learning, so this is not serious or to be of use to anyone.

Moo.
